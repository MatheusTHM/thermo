## What is it?

Hi there! 
In this project I've re-created a loved game <a href="term.ooo">Termo</a>.
This game consists of a player tryng to find the word o the day. Inspired by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>.
Besides cloning the game I've been changing it's feature to improve this beloved game! 

## Getting Started

To run this game o just have to clone the repository and install it's dependencies
This game was building using nextJS, Styled-components.
